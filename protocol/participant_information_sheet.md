# Participant Information Sheet

## Study Title:
Using Infrared Thermal Imaging (FLIR) for Assessing Burn Injuries

## Chief Investigator:
Mr Paul Drake, Consultant Burns Surgeon, Queen Victoria Hospital

### Why are we doing this study?
When someone has a burn, it is very important to know how deep it is. The depth of the burn helps us decide the best treatment and how quickly it will heal. Doctors usually make this decision by looking at the burn, but this is not always accurate.

Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) is very good at predicting burn healing but it is expensive, needs special training, and is not available in all hospitals. Another method, enzymatic debridement (a gel that removes dead tissue), shows the true depth of the burn. This makes it a good way to check how well new methods work.

This study will test whether a small thermal camera (FLIR) can measure burn depth. If it works, it could help doctors worldwide assess burns quickly and cheaply.

### What will happen if I take part?
- We will take photographs of your burn wound.
- We will take thermal images (FLIR) before and after enzymatic debridement. This is safe, quick, and does not touch you.
- If your hospital has LDI, this may also be used.
- We will record how your burn heals.

### Are there any risks or benefits?
- **Risks:** None. Photographs and FLIR images are non-invasive and safe.
- **Benefits:** You may not benefit directly, but your participation could help improve burn care for future patients.
