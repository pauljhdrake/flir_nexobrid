# Clinician Guidance for FLIR Burn Study

## Introduction
This study validates FLIR thermal imaging for burn depth assessment using enzymatic debridement as the comparator. LDI may be used in centres that have access to it.

## Responsibilities
- Identify and recruit eligible patients (≥18y, burns ≤72h, suitable for enzymatic debridement).  
- Obtain informed consent.  
- Perform clinical and FLIR imaging before and after debridement.  
- Complete data collection sheet accurately.  

## Imaging Protocol
- Room temp 20–22°C.  
- Patient acclimatisation 5 minutes.  
- Camera 30–50 cm, perpendicular to wound.  
- At least 3 FLIR images per timepoint.  
- Clinical photographs with consistent lighting and angle.  

## Data Collection
- Use anonymised IDs.  
- Record demographics, burn cause/site/%TBSA.  
- Record FLIR temps (min, max, avg).  
- Record enzymatic findings and outcomes.
