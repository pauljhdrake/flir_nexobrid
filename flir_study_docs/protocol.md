## 2. Background and Rationale
Burn depth assessment is essential for guiding treatment decisions in patients with burn injuries. The depth determines whether a burn will heal with dressings alone or if surgery is needed. However, assessing burn depth can be challenging and even experienced clinicians are not always accurate. We are therefore always looking for a more reliable, objective method that outperforms clinical assessment.

A number of technologies are available to support this process. Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) is considered the current gold standard for predicting burn healing potential. However, LDI is very expensive, requires specialist training to use properly, and is not widely available across the world. This limits its use to a small number of centres.

Enzymatic debridement has become an important tool for the selective removal of necrotic tissue in burns. Because it removes only dead tissue and leaves viable dermis intact, it provides a good way to validate burn depth assessment techniques. By revealing the viable wound bed beneath, it offers an objective reference against which other methods can be compared.

FLIR infrared thermal imaging is a promising alternative. These handheld, inexpensive cameras attach to smartphones and provide thermal maps of the skin. In theory, deeper burns appear cooler because of reduced blood flow and metabolism. If validated, this method could offer a practical, low-cost, and widely available way of improving burn depth assessment.

**The aim of this project is to assess the ability of FLIR thermal imaging to measure burn depth.** We will use enzymatic debridement as the objective comparator: thermographic images of burns will be compared to the clinical appearance of the wound after selective debridement. In centres where LDI is available, FLIR will also be compared secondarily to LDI findings.
